Some data (such as credit card numbers or full passport data) is dangerous to store in clear.
It is doubly dangerous to store such data on a mobile gadget (phone), which can be lost or easily fall into the wrong hands.
The "Secret Notes" application allows you to encrypt / decrypt any text with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm.
The resulting encrypted test can already be stored, sent by mail or share.
Encryption / decryption is compatible with the OpenSSL utility., 
The encryption result will be similar to running openssl utilities:
'openssl enc-aes-256-cbc -a'
Decryption will be similar to
'ppenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -d'
